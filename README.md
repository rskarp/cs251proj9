# cs251proj9
This was a project for my CS251: Data Analysis and Visualization course (Spring 2017). 
I used analysis techniques such as KNN classification and K-means clustering, as well as a GUI as a visualization aid, to plot and analyze
a systems bio data set displaying the bioluminscence of mouse brain cells over time before, during, and after being treated with a toxin.
(See circadian_data_README.txt for more information on the data set).
The GUI in this project was created over a span of multiple projects throughout the term. In this final project, I used this data set to
develop questions that I wanted to answer by using the existing elements of my GUI, and adding other elements if necessary. (See the
ProcessAnalysisResults.pdf file in the Process, Analysis, and Results folder for more information about my chosen questions, process
of finding the answers to the questions, and overall conclusions).
